# RaceCar

Welcome to our project in Bullet3D, the objective of this game is to reach the finish line without losing all the life of the car. To reach the goal we will have to go through different obstacles, such as changes in gravity, big jumps and a ramp full of dangers.

Created by Luis Fernández Díaz and Juan De Dios García Salguero, students of the CITM of Terrassa.
